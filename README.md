# Marvel vs Capcom 2 Ratio

# [View Site Here](https://marvelvscapcomratio.netlify.app/)

Marvel vs Capcom 2 is an iconic fighting game that is renowned for its intense, fast paced gameplay and wide cast of characters. Despite there being 56 characters in the game, MvC2 is notorious for being dominated by its top tiers. That is why the community has developed something called the ratio system. In the ratio system, you have a max amount of points to spend, usually 7, and each character costs a certain amount of points to add to your team. The ratio system encourages diverse and unique team compositions and playstyles. With the ratio system not being a direct feature official versions of the game, this website aims to help building teams that follow the rules of the ratio system much easier. The current setup follows the rules outlined [here](https://wiki.supercombo.gg/w/Marvel_vs_Capcom_2/Ratios#JWong's_2022_Ratio_List) under Justin Wong's 2022 Ratio List.
